            "description": "Google was tossing around the idea of buying Epic Games outright. Credit: Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority Internal emails show that Google was considering buying a controlling stake in Epic Games even before Stadia launched. Google reportedly wanted to influence Epic’s approach to Android. Stadia lead Phil Harrison suggested just buying Epic Games out entirely. Currently, Google is in a court fight with Epic Games, being accused of stifling app competition. Since the case kicked off, there have been some interesting revelations, but the latest discovery about Google and the Fortnite creator may be the most surprising yet. The Verge has obtained internal emails from Google that reference a 2018 strategy called “Project Elektra.” It appears that Project Elektra was a plan to obtain influence over Epic Games by purchasing a controlling stake in the company or buying it outright.",

I have also tried minimising the game and changing the volume in the bottom right of the desktop to get the \"bonging\" confirmation but there is no sound either. If I change to the headphone jack I can hear the bonging but it sounds electrically distorted. However in game sound seems to be fine. The other issue I experience is a sudden drop in FPS (from ~170 to ~ 20-60) which is accompanied with the same electric distortion noise. Using the Windows audio troub/eshooting tool I get a list of detected issues (see photos on other post). All telling me the device is unplugged, I have used 3 different HDMIs with no change.
