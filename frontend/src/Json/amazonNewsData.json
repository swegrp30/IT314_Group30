If you’re looking for health-centric savings during the Black Friday sales season, this Blueair compact indoor air purifier will ensure you feel better without breaking a sweat – or the bank! Amazon is selling the Blueair Blue Pure 511 for just £89. That’s a 10% saving, which is available between now and December 5. Save £10 on the compact Blueair Blue Pure 511 air purifier The compact but powerful Blue Pure 511 is on sale for Black Friday. You can save £10 on this awesome air purifier right now. Amazon Was £99 Now £89 View Deal The Pure Blue 511 is the most compact air filter offered by Blueair to feature the HEPASilent technology. It’s affordable and highly effective, it works quickly, and is energy efficient. The dual filtration HEPASilent technology developed by Blueair, is a breakthrough that pledges to deliver 45% more clean air faster, all while using 67% less energy and creating 67% less noise than a standard HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) Filter. These advances still enable 99.97% of airborne particles, all the way down to 0.1 micron² in size, to be captured by the Pure Blue 511. That includes viruses and bacteria, alongside larger particles like dust, pollen, and smoke. It’ll take care of mould allergen and capture household odours from pets and cooking too. Purer, and cleaner smelling air in the room where you sleep for just £89 sounds like a great investment to us. This compact model is designed for smaller rooms, up to 38 square metres in size – like bedrooms, nurseries, or home offices – and, despite the size, this model does its work quickly. In a room around 16 square meters in size, the air will be purified in as little as 12 and a half minutes. For 38m2 rooms, the Blue Pure 511 takes care of business in just half an hour. The Blue Pure 511 also runs incredibly quietly in the pursuit of its noble duties – as low as 24 decibels with the fan on low speed – so it won’t keep you awake at night while still keeping the air you breathe pure. Operation couldn’t be simpler as there’s single button control to enable night, everyday, and boost modes. If you’re concerned adding another appliance due to spiralling energy bills (as many of us are heading into the winter), the Blueair Blue Pure 511 uses less energy than a lightbulb during regular use, and the rapid performance means use can be sparing, while yielding great results, if necessary. The compact (340mm x 200mm) and attractive cylindrical design bucks the trend of bulky, eyesore air purifiers. Indeed, it looks more like a high-end speaker than an air purifier, and the pre-filters are machine washable too. When in use for 24 hours a day, these replaceable filters last for six months and an indicator light will inform you when its time. An air purifier is a fantastic investment in your overall health and wellbeing, and with simple operation, an unobtrusive design, and incredibly powerful performance, there’s no better way to begin your 2024 health goals early. For larger rooms, check out the Blueair Blue Max 3250, which offers the same technological advancements and eye-pleasing design but can purify the air across a 48 square metre room. The Blue Max 3250 is £30 off for Black Friday. This article has been published in partnership with Blueair. You can read about our partnership policies here.

            "description": "The Acer Aspire 1, a budget laptop with a 15.6-inch Full HD screen, is currently even cheaper from Amazon's Black Friday laptop deals following a $41 discount. Acer There are Black Friday laptop deals for top-of-the-line machines, but if all you need is a basic device for simple tasks, you should be going for a budget option like the Acer Aspire 1. Originally priced at $230, it’s currently even cheaper from Amazon for Black Friday at $189, for savings of $41. Its price may return to normal at any moment though, as we’re not sure how much stock is allocated for the shopping holiday, so if you want to get this laptop for less than $200, you need to complete the purchase as soon as you can. Buy Now Why you should buy the Acer Aspire 1 laptop The Acer Aspire 1 isn’t going to offer similar performance as the best laptops with its Intel Celeron N4500 processor, integrated Intel UHD Graphics, and 4GB of RAM. However, these specifications are more than enough for day-to-day functions like browsing the internet, checking social media, and building reports. The laptop is also a great choice for watching streaming shows, as it features a 15.6-inch screen with Full HD resolution, so you’ll be getting sharp details and bright colors. The 128GB eMMC of the Acer Aspire 1 offers ample storage space for your files, and it ships with Windows 11 in S Mode. To further boost your productivity, the Acer Aspire 1 comes with a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal so you’ll be able to use apps like Word and PowerPoint, and an extensive suite of ports that includes three USB ports, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a headphone jack. If you’re on the hunt for a cheap laptop from Black Friday deals, you may want to set your sights on the Acer Aspire 1. It’s already pretty affordable at its sticker price of $230, but you can get it for even cheaper from Amazon at just $189 following a $41 discount. It’s not a good idea to wait until the last minute of the shopping holiday before you make the purchase though, as the offer may be gone by then, and we’re not sure if you’ll get another chance on Cyber Monday. To make sure that you get the Acer Aspire 1 for a bargain, push through with the transaction immediately. Buy Now",

The Blueair Blue Max 3250 is your ticket to cleaner air in your living space and a great way to promote wellbeing heading into 2024. This high performance air purifier is 20% off for Black Friday. The Amazon-exclusive Blueair Blue Max 3250 product is 20% off for the Black Friday sales, bringing the price down to just £119 from the usual £149 asking price. The offer is in place through December 5. Save big on pure air with Blueair’s Black Friday special The brilliant Blueair Blue Max 3250 home air purifier is a wonderful investment in the health of your household and it’s 30% off on Black Friday. Amazon Was £149 Now £119 View Deal This larger model, from the UK’s most-awarded air purifier brand, boasts Blueair’s unique HEPASilent technology, which promises 83% faster cleansing of the air with 50% less noise vs previous generation models. Users will also benefit from a 45% more clean air faster than air purifiers using standard HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters. The Blueair Blue Max 3250 puts its HEPASilent technology to great use, launching a three-pronged, 360-degree attack to purify the air in your room. The end-result is the filtering of 99.97% of harmful tiny airborne particles, down to 0.1 microns in size. Firstly, there’s a fabric pre-filter that catches the larger particles from the air. The next layer of defence is an activated carbon filter that’ll capture and trap light household smells from pets cooking and smoking. Finally, the main filter will get rid of those pesky airborne allergens like pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mould, bacteria, and viruses. The Blue Max 3250 does its work quickly and eagerly. In a room up to 48 square metres, you’ll purify the living space in just half an our. Stick it on high for 12 and a half minutes and you’ll have clean air throughout a 20m2 room. As well as helping to eradicate odours, it won’t kick up a stink in the noise department either. Blueair calls the Blue Max 3250 “whisper quiet” and it barely registers at just 18db. There’s little chance of it disturbing your sleep while helping to purify the air in the master bedroom. This Blue Max 3250 model includes the added bonus of an air quality LED indicator. A blue light means “excellent”, while green is “good”. If you see that red light, it’s time to put the Blue Max 3250 to work. There are on-device touch controls with three fan speed settings, as well as an auto mode, and night mode. There’s a child lock too. With concern about ever increasing energy bills, the Blueair Blue Max 3250 surprisingly uses less energy than a lightbulb, with consumption as low as 2.5w on the low fan speed setting. While most of the air purifiers we see are bowling shoe-ugly, the Blueair Blue models look more like high-end speakers. The pre-filters are machine washable and will last 6-9 months before requiring a replacement. If you’re looking for a smaller model for a second bedroom or home office, the Blue Pure 511 is a great option for rooms up to 38 square metres in size. It’s also on sale for Black Friday. You can save £10 between now and December 5. This article has been published in partnership with Blueair. You can read about our partnership policies here.
